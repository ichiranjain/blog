### Arrays and Strings - 1

##### 11. Minimum Window Substring

```
Given two strings s and t, return the minimum window in s which will contain all the characters in t. If there is no such window in s that covers all characters in t, return the empty string "".

Note that If there is such a window, it is guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in s.



Example 1:

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"

Example 2:

Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"



Constraints:

    1 <= s.length, t.length <= 105
    s and t consist of English letters.


Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(n) time?

```

##### 12. Valid Palindrome

```
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

Note: For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.

Example 1:

Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: "race a car"
Output: false



Constraints:

    s consists only of printable ASCII characters.


```


##### 13. Majority Element II

```

Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than ⌊ n/3 ⌋ times.

Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?



Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: [3]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: [1]

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: [1,2]



Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
    -109 <= nums[i] <= 109



```

##### 14. Product of Array Except Self

```
Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example:

Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Constraint: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.

Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

```


##### 15. Missing Number

```
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?



Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 4:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: 1
Explanation: n = 1 since there is 1 number, so all numbers are in the range [0,1]. 1 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.



Constraints:

    n == nums.length
    1 <= n <= 104
    0 <= nums[i] <= n
    All the numbers of nums are unique.


```


##### 16. First Unique Character in a String


```

Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

Examples:

s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode"
return 2.



Note: You may assume the string contains only lowercase English letters.


```

##### 17.  Subarray Sum Equals K

```

Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
Output: 2



Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
    -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
    -107 <= k <= 107



```


##### 18. Squares of a Sorted Array

```
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]



Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 104
    -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
    nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.


Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?
```

##### 19. Valid Parentheses

```
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

    Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.



Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true

Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false

Example 4:

Input: s = "([)]"
Output: false

Example 5:

Input: s = "{[]}"
Output: true



Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 104
    s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.


```


##### 19. Trapping Rain Water

```

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.



Example 1:

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9



Constraints:

    n == height.length
    0 <= n <= 3 * 104
    0 <= height[i] <= 105

```

##### 20. Sparse Matrix Multiplication

```
Given two sparse matrices A and B, return the result of AB.

You may assume that A's column number is equal to B's row number.

Example:

Input:

A = [
  [ 1, 0, 0],
  [-1, 0, 3]
]

B = [
  [ 7, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 1 ]
]

Output:

     |  1 0 0 |   | 7 0 0 |   |  7 0 0 |
AB = | -1 0 3 | x | 0 0 0 | = | -7 0 3 |
                  | 0 0 1 |



Constraints:

    1 <= A.length, B.length <= 100
    1 <= A[i].length, B[i].length <= 100
    -100 <= A[i][j], B[i][j] <= 100


```
